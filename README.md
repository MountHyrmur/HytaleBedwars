## Hytale Bedwars Plugin
Recreation of the classic Hypixel minigame Bedwars for Hytale.

> [!CAUTION]
>❗ Currently heavily work in progress, not finished at all.<br>
>❗ (since Hytale isn't even out lol)

### Development plan
#### Before Hytale release
- [ ] Plan out and prepare the structure and code for the json data files
- [ ] Code parts of logic that can be made ahead of time or abstracted away
#### After Hytale release
- [ ] Wire up abstracted logic
- [ ] Write remaining logic to get basic features (bases, beds, generators, shops) working
- [ ] Release first version
- [ ] Code more features and keep releasing updates/fixes
- [ ] Get a good feel of Hytale's structure, inner workings, features and the needs of this plugin while doing that
- [ ] Do v2, a big refactor/rewrite to better use Hytale's API, and fix any design mistakes that probably were made
- [ ] Keep maintaining the plugin and add the advanced features and QOL tools



### Planned features
- All the basics - teams, beds, shops, generators, upgrades, traps
- Default configs with values similar to Minecraft/Hypixel
- Familiar fireball and tnt physics (fireball jumping)
- Rotating items
- Team chat
- Team chests (with punch deposit)
- Advanced hotbar loadout
- Nice HUD for players with info
- Helper tools for setting up maps, shops
- Statistics
- EVERYTHING completely data driven and configurable using assets - maps, resources, shops, messages
